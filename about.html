                        <strong> I used to be a pack rat</strong>. I had so many things that 
                        I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even 
                        appreciate any of it because there was too much.

                    <p class="article-body">
                        Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.

                        <strong> I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything</strong>. I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.
                    </p>
                    <p class="article-body">
                        It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.

                        Now that I'm living a simple life, 
                        things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life 
                        and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.

                        With how much it turned my life around,<strong> I felt like I had no choice but 
                        to start sharing how I did it</strong>, and how others can benefit from 
                        living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!
